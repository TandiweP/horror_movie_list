# Horror Movie List

# Description: 
Who doesn't love a good horror movie?
This is a list of Bootstrap cards that pull horror movies (with data) from a json file and renders them to the cards. It is a modulated React program and is function oriented. 

# Purpose
As a horror fan, this list allows me to keep track of movies I have seen along with their information and my own rating. 

# Future Improvements: 
a. Give each card a glow-effect when the mouse hovers over it. I'm thinking gooey flourescent green via the border styling. 
b. Tidy up font styles and weights.
c. Add more movies: this will be easier if I convert the code to OOP using a Movie Class to set up objects.
