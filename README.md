# horror_movie_list
Locally routed list of horror movies. 


Description: 
This is a list of Bootstrap card that pulls a few horror movies (with data) from a json file and renders them to the cards. 

Future Improvements: 
a. Give each card a glow-effect when the mouse hovers over it. I'm thinking gooey flourescent green via the border styling. 
b. Tidy up font styles and weights.
c. Add about 100 more movies, starting with a few I've been meaning to get around to watching...
